		This challenge contiues to build on everything done so far AND the work you completed last tutorial.
		Some of the tasks you are expected to do will challenge your understanding of programming skills and appreciation of this programs logic; please dont 'cheat' (that doesn't mean dont ask friends, tutors etc, it means please take the time to understand how and what is happening.  

		Some areas of interest include changes to the following animation and logic loop as well as the key released functions


		Tasks:
			1. Get this program running in Chrome and test it; don't forget to enable to console to view debug messages
			2. Review the changes implemented in this release against any you programmed based on the previous task lists; as we have now implemented an endless sky by using two of the same images - to help illustrate when the first ends we have added a small green rectangle on the right hand edge of the original sky image; keep an eye out as it moves 
			3. When the user releases the space key the program switchs the bBullet variable to true - then the system checks the state of this variable, if true calls a new function called fnBullet; review and hack around with the code
			4. We have added another control variable bExplode - we will use this to control the explosion being displayed
			5. Unfortunately, although our collision works it doesn’t feel very good from a player point of view; this is probably before the collision is based on the full size of the enemy (the whole square). Consider the problem and try to implement a much better collision function – this will likely require a bit of trial and error
			6. Well done, now you have a better collision apply the same solution to each of the enemies
			7. Well done, your collision is now working on each of the enemies - expand your code so that hit enemies are removed from the game (so they are not drawn)
			8. Well done, check to make sure the removed enemies are not being checked when the player shoots - dont forget, if they are gone they are gone
